# **Goodreads-Book-Search** React App with a Node server on Heroku

A minimal example of using a Node backend (server for API, proxy, & routing) with a [React frontend](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
This application uses goodreads api to look for books by title, author or isbn code.

This project is deployed live at https://still-garden-60707.herokuapp.com/

To deploy a frontend-only React app, use the static-site optimized  
▶️ [create-react-app-buildpack](https://github.com/mars/create-react-app-buildpack)

⤵️ [Switching from create-react-app-buildpack](#switching-from-create-react-app-buildpack)?


## Design Points

A combo of two npm projects, the backend server and the frontend UI. So there are two `package.json` configs and thereforce [two places to run `npm` commands](#user-content-local-development):

  1. [**Node server**](server/): [`./package.json`](package.json)
      * [deployed automatically](https://devcenter.heroku.com/categories/deployment) via heroku/nodejs buildpack
  2. [**React UI**](react-ui/): [`react-ui/package.json`](react-ui/package.json)
      * generated by [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)
      * deployed via `build` script in the Node server's [`./package.json`](package.json)
      * module cache configured by `cacheDirectories`

Includes a minimal [Node Cluster](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v8.x/api/cluster.html) [implementation](server/index.js) to parallelize the single-threaded Node process across the available CPU cores.

## Demo

[Demo deployment](https://still-garden-60707.herokuapp.com/): example API call from the React UI is [fetched with a relative URL](react-ui/src/App.js#L16) that is served by an Express handler in the Node server.


## Deploy to Heroku

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShubhamAnand/goodreadsreact.git
cd goodreadsreact/
heroku create
git push heroku master
```

This deployment will automatically:

  * detect [Node buildpack](https://elements.heroku.com/buildpacks/heroku/heroku-buildpack-nodejs)
  * build the app with
    * `npm install` for the Node server
    * `npm run build` for create-react-app
  * launch the web process with `npm start`
    * serves `../react-ui/build/` as static files
    * customize by adding API, proxy, or route handlers/redirectors

⚠️ Using npm 5’s new `package-lock.json`? We resolved a compatibility issue. See [PR](https://github.com/mars/heroku-cra-node/pull/10) for more details.

## Switching from create-react-app-buildpack

If an app was previously deployed with [create-react-app-buildpack](https://github.com/mars/create-react-app-buildpack), then a few steps are required to migrate the app to this architecture:

1. Remove **create-react-app-buildpack** from the app; [heroku/nodejs buildpack](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/nodejs-support#activation) will be automatically activated
  
    ```bash
    heroku buildpacks:clear
    ```
1. Move the root React app files (including dotfiles) into a `react-ui/` subdirectory

    ```bash
    mkdir react-ui
    git mv -k [!react-ui]* react-ui/
    mv node_modules react-ui/
    
    # If you see "fatal: Not a git repository", then fix that error
    mv react-ui/.git ./
    ```
    ⚠️ *Some folks have reported problems with these commands. Using the `bash` shell will probably allow them to work. Sorry if they do not work for you, know that the point is to move **everything** in the repo into the `react-ui/` subdirectory. Except for `.git/` which should remain at the root level.* 
1. Create a root [`package.json`](package.json), [`server/`](server/), & [`.gitignore`](.gitignore) modeled after the code in this repo
1. Commit and deploy ♻️
  
    ```bash
    git add -A
    git commit -m 'Migrate from create-react-app-buildpack to Node server'
    git push heroku master
    ```
  

## Local Development

Because this app is made of two npm projects, there are two places to run `npm` commands:

1. **Node API server** at the root `./`
1. **React UI** in `react-ui/` directory.

### Run the API server

In a terminal:

```bash
# Initial setup
npm install

# Start the server
npm start
```

#### Install new npm packages for Node

```bash
npm install package-name --save
```


### Run the React UI
**Prerequisites:** You need to have Node + NPM installed.

**Required Environment Variables:**

`REACT_APP_API_KEY` : Goodreads API Key you can get from [here](https://www.goodreads.com/api/keys).

Save it in the `.env` file as described [here](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#adding-custom-environment-variables)

Having done that, here is how to run the application locally in development mode.

The React app is configured to proxy backend requests to the local Node server. (See [`"proxy"` config](react-ui/package.json))

In a separate terminal from the API server, start the UI:


#### Install new npm packages for React UI

```bash
# Always change directory, first
cd react-ui/

npm install package-name --save


# Building the application:

To build the production assets, run

    npm run build

# Testing the App:

Right now there is only one test suite. (renders without crashing)

    npm test

# Features In Current Version 1:

1. Search for books by title, author, or ISBN.
2. Resets Search Query using Reset Otion provided.
3. Displays upto 20 search results in Material UI cards.
4. Displays title, author, and link to goodreads page.
5. See the description and rating of book and brief details about book by clicking on individual result.
6. Single Page Application with extensive caching, so application loads very fast post first load.

# Future Implementation in more time:

Some of the things that re left out due to time constraints but I will add them in future are:

1. Writing Snapshot & Unit Tests for all components using Jest & Enzyme with >80% functional coverage 
2. Ability to login to the Application using Single Sign in.
3. Save favourite books by creating a like icon for personalized list of book for logged in user.
4. Ability to follow author & provide notifications to user on latest books from Author.

```
